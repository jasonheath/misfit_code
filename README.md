# The Repository of Misfit Code

Here there be broken toys.

At some point it occurred to me that a monorepo to toss all of the weird one off
experiments and learning pieces I write would be cool and somehow it flashed
into my head to rigg on (Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and the Island of Misfit Toys)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_the_Red-Nosed_Reindeer_and_the_Island_of_Misfit_Toys].
So, that's what this is.  A bunch of toy experiments that are more likely to be
broken nonsense than anything useful becaused I learned whatever I need to and
moved on.
